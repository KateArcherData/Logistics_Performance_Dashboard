# 🚚 Logistics Performance Dashboard

### 📊 Overview
The **Logistics Performance Dashboard** is an intermediate-to-advanced Power BI project designed to analyse shipment efficiency, delivery performance, and cost across regions and carriers.  
It transforms operational logistics data into actionable business insights through interactive visuals, KPI cards, and advanced DAX calculations.

### 🧭 Project Objective
To develop a professional-quality Power BI dashboard that:
- Monitors on-time delivery performance by carrier and region  
- Identifies cost efficiency opportunities  
- Enables drillthrough exploration and regional insights  
- Demonstrates strong DAX, data modelling, and storytelling skills  

---

### 🗂️ Dashboard Pages
1. **Executive Summary** – Overall KPIs and key metrics  
2. **Delivery Performance** – Carrier-level performance and ranking  
3. **Cost & Efficiency** – Cost analysis by shipment and distance  
4. **Regional Insights** – Performance comparison across UK regions  

---

### ⚙️ Tools & Techniques
- **Power BI Desktop** – Dashboard design, visuals, bookmarks, and navigation  
- **DAX** – Advanced calculations (`RANKX`, `TOPN`, `ADDCOLUMNS`, `SWITCH`)  
- **Excel** – Data cleaning, preparation, and structure validation  
- **Power Query** – Data transformations  
- **GitHub** – Project documentation and version control
