# üìä DAX Measures ‚Äì Logistics Performance Dashboard

This document lists all DAX measures created for the **Logistics Performance Dashboard** Power BI project.  
They are grouped by purpose: KPI, Cost, Carriers, Regional, and Dynamic Text.

---

## üü© 1. KPI Measures
Core metrics for operational and delivery performance.

### Total Shipments
Total Shipments = 
COUNTROWS(Shipments)

### On-Time %
On-Time % = 
DIVIDE(
	CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Shipments),
	Shipments[Status] = "Delivered On Time"), 
	COUNTROWS(Shipments)
)

### Avg Delay Days
Avg Delay Days = 
AVERAGEX(
	FILTER(Shipments,
	Shipments[Status]="Delayed"),
	DATEDIFF(Shipments[ShipmentDate],
	Shipments[DeliveryDate],
	Day)
)

### Avg Delivery Time
Avg Delivery Time = 
	AVERAGEX(Shipments, 
	DATEDIFF(Shipments[ShipmentDate], 
	Shipments[DeliveryDate], 
	DAY)
)

### Total Delayed Shipments
Total Delayed Shipments = 
CALCULATE(
	COUNTROWS(Shipments),
	Shipments[Status] = "Delayed"
)


---

## üü¶ 2. Cost Measures
Measures supporting the Cost & Efficiency page.

### Total Cost
Total Cost = 
SUM(Shipments[Cost]
)

### Avg Cost per Shipment
Avg Cost per Shipment = 
DIVIDE([Total Cost], [Total Shipments]
)

### Cost per Mile
Cost per Mile = 
DIVIDE(SUM(Shipments[Cost]), 
SUM(Shipments[Distance])
)

### Avg Cost by Month
Avg Cost by Month = 
AVERAGE(Shipments[Cost]
)

---

## üü® 3. Carrier Measures
Measures for ranking and analysing carrier performance.

### Carrier On-Time %
Carrier On-Time % = 
DIVIDE(
	CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Shipments),
	Shipments[Status]="Delivered On Time"),
	COUNTROWS(Shipments)
	)

### Carrier Rank
Carrier Rank = 
VAR CURRENTVALUE = 
	CALCULATE([Carrier On-Time %]) 
		RETURN IF(ISBLANK(CURRENTVALUE),BLANK(),
		RANKX(ALL(Shipments[Carrier]),
		CALCULATE([Carrier On-Time %]),
		CURRENTVALUE,
		DESC,
		Dense)
	)

## üüß 4. Regional Measures
Measures supporting the Regional Insights page.

### Best Region
Best Region =
VAR SummaryTable =
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        SUMMARIZE(Shipments, Shipments[Region]),
        "OnTimeValue", [On-Time %]
    )
VAR TopRegion =
    TOPN(1, SummaryTable, [OnTimeValue], DESC)
RETURN
    MAXX(TopRegion, Shipments[CustomerRegion])

### Best Region On-Time %
Best Region On-Time % =
VAR SummaryTable =
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        SUMMARIZE(Shipments, Shipments[CustomerRegion]),
        "OnTimeValue", [On-Time %]
    )
RETURN
    MAXX(SummaryTable, [OnTimeValue])

### Highest Cost Region
Highest Cost Region =
VAR SummaryTable =
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        SUMMARIZE(Shipments, Shipments[CustomerRegion]),
        "TotalCost", [Total Cost]
    )
VAR TopRegion =
    TOPN(1, SummaryTable, [TotalCost], DESC)
RETURN
    MAXX(TopRegion, Shipments[Region])

### Highest Cost Region Value
Highest Cost Region Value =
VAR SummaryTable =
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        SUMMARIZE(Shipments, Shipments[CustomerRegion]),
        "TotalCost", [Total Cost]
    )
VAR TopRegion =
    TOPN(1, SummaryTable, [TotalCost], DESC)
RETURN
    MAXX(TopRegion, [TotalCost])

### Worst Region
Worst Region = VAR SummaryTable = 
ADDCOLUMNS(
	SUMMARIZE(Shipments,Shipments[CustomerRegion]),
	"OnTimeValue",[On-Time %]
	) 
VAR LowestRegion = 
	TOPN(1, SummaryTable, [OnTimeValue], ASC) 
RETURN 
	MAXX(LowestRegion, Shipments[CustomerRegion])

## üü™ 5. Dynamic Text Measures
Narrative and title measures for storytelling visuals.

### Regional Commentary
Regional Summary Text = 
"üèÜ"&[Best Region]&" is leading with "&
FORMAT([Best Region On-Time %],"0.0%")&
" on-time delivery, while "&
[Worst Region] & " has the highest delays."

### Dashboard Title Pg 1
Dashboard Title = 
"Logistics Performance Overview - " &SELECTEDVALUE('Calendar'[Year])

### Dashboard Title Pg 2
Dashboard Title Pg 2 = 
"Delivery Performance - " &SELECTEDVALUE('Calendar'[Year])

### Dashboard Title Pg 3
Dashboard Title Pg 3 = 
"Cost & Efficiency -" &SELECTEDVALUE('Shipments'[Carrier])

### Dashboard Title Pg 4
Dashboard Title Pg 4 = 
"Regional Insights - " &SELECTEDVALUE('Calendar'[Year])

## üß† Notes
- All measures are stored in a dedicated **Measures** table, grouped by **Display Folder** (KPIs, Cost, Carriers, Regional, Dynamic Text).  
- Naming conventions use clear prefixes (`KPI_`, `CARR_`, `REG_`, etc.) for readability.  
- Measures are written to be **context-aware** ‚Äî they change dynamically when filtered by Carrier, or Year.  
- This documentation allows others to review all DAX logic without needing access to the `.pbix` file.
